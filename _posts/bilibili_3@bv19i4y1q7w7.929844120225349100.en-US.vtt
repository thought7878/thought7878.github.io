Title: 006 Javascript Engine
Language: en-US
Label: 英语（美国）

0
00:00:01.190 --> 00:00:07.940
Almost everyone that has worked with JavaScript has heard of the V8 engine, the idea of the JavaScript

1
00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:15.090
engine, and most people know that JavaScript is a single threaded language, that it uses a callback

2
00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:15.320
to you.

3
00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:20.280
You may also hear phrases like JavaScript is an interpreted language.

4
00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:23.910
Let's tackle what that means over the next couple of videos.

5
00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:26.960
What is this engine that we speak of?

6
00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:35.780
Well, if I write some code like let's say CONSED is happy equals to true.

7
00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:44.200
Well, we just wrote some JavaScript I'm assigning the true boolean to the variable is happy.

8
00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:49.470
Now, how do we read this or how does the computer read this?

9
00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:56.240
Imagine if somebody comes up to you and gives you a computer and they tell you, hey, tell this computer

10
00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:58.900
to display a picture of horses on the screen.

11
00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:07.490
And you start looking at this computer and you tell the computer to display an image of a horse or horses

12
00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:10.400
in French, is the computer going to understand you?

13
00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:14.090
No, the computer would have no idea what you just said.

14
00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:20.320
In similar fashion, if I gave a computer with a CPU.

15
00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.460
A file that is a JavaScript file.

16
00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:30.740
And I tell it, hey, read this file and do something for me while the computer only understands ones

17
00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:36.830
and zeros at the end of the day and when we give it the JavaScript file, it's like me talking to a

18
00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:40.580
computer and French and the computer being like, what?

19
00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:41.360
What are you talking about?

20
00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:46.510
Plus, talking to a computer in French while people are going to look at you like you're a crazy person.

21
00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:51.260
So the computer doesn't really know what JavaScript is.

22
00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:59.300
So how are we able to communicate using a JavaScript file so that the computer displays pictures of

23
00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.750
horses?

24
00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:07.910
And this is the first step in our learning, and that is the JavaScript engine, by having a JavaScript

25
00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:13.630
engine right over here, it allows you to give this machine the JavaScript file.

26
00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:21.140
And this machine is going to understand this file and tell the computer what to do to display pictures

27
00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:21.740
of horses.

28
00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:28.610
In a sense, you just created a translator so you can communicate with somebody that doesn't know your

29
00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:29.060
language.

30
00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:35.490
And this special engine called JavaScript Engine understands JavaScript.

31
00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:42.370
Our computer finally understands us because of this JavaScript engine and it says, I'm on it, boss.

32
00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:44.610
I'll start displaying those horse pictures.

33
00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:46.530
There you go.

34
00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:51.530
That's our first step, and over the next couple of videos, we're going to talk about exactly what's

35
00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:52.460
happening inside.

36
00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:56.930
But do you think there's one JavaScript engine or many JavaScript engines?

37
00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:06.640
Well, as you can see from this Wikipedia list, there are a ton of engines and they're called ECMAScript

38
00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:08.860
engines and we'll get into why that is later.

39
00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:15.340
But these are all the JavaScript engines, some of them you may have heard of, like VATE or Spider

40
00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:16.840
Monkey or chocker.

41
00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:22.840
So any time we use an engine, we're able to give it a JavaScript file.

42
00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:28.960
And this JavaScript file gets understood by the engine and it allows this engine to communicate and

43
00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:35.260
tell the machine, the computer to do what we ask it to do with JavaScript.

44
00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:44.710
Now, these engines are ridden by programmers, for example, V8 engine is written in C++, but why

45
00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:46.870
do people write these engines?

46
00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:55.300
2008 marked a really pivotal moment in history when it comes to JavaScript because VATE was released

47
00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:56.080
by Google.

48
00:03:56.470 --> 00:04:03.820
Before then, most browsers used engines that were very basic, which meant that JavaScript was a little

49
00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:04.960
bit slow.

50
00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:07.150
You see, Google had this problem.

51
00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:08.770
They had something called Google Maps.

52
00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:13.480
And Google Maps, as you know, requires a lot of power.

53
00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:15.250
It does a lot of things.

54
00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:21.970
You can ask for directions to zoom in and zoom out, maybe even use Street View and all the previous

55
00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:26.290
engines before it would make Google Maps very, very slow on the browser.

56
00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:29.910
And Google, because they're a search engine.

57
00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:36.400
They want everybody to use their search engine and they built a browser in order for them to control

58
00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:37.200
more of the market.

59
00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:43.660
So with Google Maps and their own Chrome browser, they said, we're going to write our own JavaScript

60
00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:50.800
engine, the V8 engine, so that JavaScript runs way faster on the browser than it's done previously.

61
00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:54.360
And in 2008, they released Veidt.

62
00:04:54.520 --> 00:05:00.280
But the big takeaway for us here is that really, really smart people work on these engines so that

63
00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:08.050
our JavaScript runs as fast as possible on the browser, on the server or any type of computer.

64
00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:14.680
So every day JavaScript gets faster and faster for us because of the work that goes into these engines.

65
00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:22.330
OK, but what is inside this engine, this magical machine that understands JavaScript, it reads our

66
00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:24.580
code and then it runs this code.
