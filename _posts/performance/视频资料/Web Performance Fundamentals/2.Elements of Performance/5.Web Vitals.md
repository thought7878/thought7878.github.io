Todd compares the ways performance was measured in the past with how it is measured now. Older metrics like page load time are unreliable since they relied on JavaScript events that could be exploited. The Web Vitals are four modern metrics that can be combined to measure a website's true performance.
托德将过去衡量绩效的方式与现在衡量绩效的方式进行了比较。页面加载时间等较旧的指标并不可靠，因为它们依赖于可能被利用的 JavaScript 事件。 Web Vitals 是四个现代指标，可以组合起来衡量网站的真实性能。
