### AI

As an AI language model, I do not have the capacity to ask questions or to have an opinion. However, it would be great to know more about the company's culture and the team's way of working together. It would be interesting to learn how the company values collaboration, communication, and learning. Also, I would love to know how the team approaches problem-solving and what their development process looks like.  
作为一个人工智能语言模型，我没有能力提出问题或发表意见。然而，**如果能更多地了解公司的文化和团队的合作方式**，那就太好了。了解公司如何重视协作、沟通和学习将会很有趣。另外，我很想知道团队如何解决问题以及**他们的开发流程是什么样的**。

120.您从过去的专业工作经历中学到了什么？

> Do some retrospection on your past working experience, this question is not about detailed technical skills, but rather interviewer wants to hear more about your general **attitude, methodology, principal** towards work.  
> 回顾一下你过去的工作经历，这个问题不是问具体的技术能力，而是**面试官想更多地了解你对工作的总体态度、方法论、原则**。

### AI

During my past professional working experiences, I have learned a lot about working collaboratively with colleagues and communicating effectively with clients. I have also learned to be adaptable and flexible in my approach to work, and to be able to accommodate unexpected changes or shifting priorities without losing focus. Additionally, I have learned the importance of being organized and prioritizing tasks to ensure that deadlines are met and projects are completed efficiently. Overall, these experiences have taught me to be proactive, accountable, and committed to delivering high-quality work to meet the needs of both the company and the clients.

### AI

As an AI language model, I don't have preferences nor interests. However, currently, one of the newest web techniques that many front-end developers are interested in is **WebAssembly**. It is a low-level bytecode format that allows bringing compiled languages like C, C++, and Rust to the web with native-level performance. This opens up possibilities for building more powerful and complex web applications, including games, image and video editing tools, and data visualization software, to name a few. It could also reduce the need for server-side computation for some operations, making web applications faster and more responsive. If I were a developer working on a project, I would be interested in exploring how WebAssembly could optimize the application's performance and improve its user experience.  
作为一个AI语言模型，我没有偏好，也没有兴趣。然而，目前许多前端开发人员感兴趣的最新 Web 技术之一是 WebAssembly。它是一种低级字节码格式，允许将 C、C++ 和 Rust 等编译语言引入网络并具有本机级别的性能。这为构建更强大、更复杂的 Web 应用程序提供了可能性，其中包括游戏、图像和视频编辑工具以及数据可视化软件等。它还可以减少某些操作对服务器端计算的需求，使 Web 应用程序更快、响应更快。如果我是一名从事项目的开发人员，我会对探索 WebAssembly 如何优化应用程序的性能并改善其用户体验感兴趣。

## 110. What is your strength and weakness.

110.你的优点和缺点是什么。

> Just be honest, everyone has weakness.  
> 老实说，每个人都有弱点。
> 
> Interviewers wants to believe that you are **clear about yourself** and **are always trying to improve**, so do mention the actions you are taking to improve your weakness.  
> 面试官希望相信你对自己很清楚，并且总是在努力改进，所以一定要提及你正在采取哪些行动来改善自己的弱点。

### AI

For my strength, I would say that I have strong attention to detail. I am meticulous about ensuring that every aspect of what I am working on is perfect and meets the required standards. This skill has helped me in creating highly functional and visually appealing websites and applications.  
就我的优势而言，我想说的是我非常注重细节。我一丝不苟地确保我所做工作的每个方面都是完美的并符合所需的标准。这项技能帮助我创建了功能强大且具有视觉吸引力的网站和应用程序。

As for my weakness, I tend to become too invested in my work and can be a bit of a perfectionist. Sometimes, this can lead to me spending too much time on a particular aspect of a project and missing deadlines. However, I am aware of this and have been working on developing better time management skills and setting realistic deadlines for myself to ensure that I deliver quality work on time.  
至于我的弱点，我倾向于对工作投入过多，并且可能有点完美主义者。有时，这可能会导致我在项目的某个特定方面花费太多时间并错过最后期限。然而，我意识到了这一点，并一直致力于培养更好的时间管理技能，并为自己设定切合实际的截止日期，以确保我按时交付高质量的工作。

我一生中最重要的决定是当我决定搬到另一个国家学习时。我一直有兴趣在著名大学攻读计算机科学学位，并且我知道我必须迈出这一步才能实现我的职业目标。

However, there were several obstacles that I had to face, such as adapting to a new culture, language barriers, and financial challenges. Nevertheless, I was determined to make it work, and I took every opportunity to immerse myself in the new surroundings and learn as much as I could.  
然而，我必须面对一些障碍，例如适应新文化、语言障碍和财务挑战。尽管如此，我决心让它发挥作用，并利用一切机会让自己沉浸在新环境中并尽可能多地学习。

I sought out bilingual courses, participated in events, and made connections with local students and professors. I even took up part-time jobs to support myself financially while studying.  
我寻找双语课程，参加活动，并与当地学生和教授建立联系。我什至在学习期间还兼职工作来养活自己。

### AI

For example, if the company values innovation and creativity, you can say that you thrive in an environment that encourages experimentation and supports new ideas. Alternatively, if the company values collaboration and teamwork, you can mention that you enjoy working with others and are always willing to help out when needed.  
例如，如果公司重视创新和创造力，您可以说您在鼓励实验和支持新想法的环境中蓬勃发展。或者，如果公司重视协作和团队合作，您可以提到您喜欢与他人合作，并且总是愿意在需要时提供帮助。

Overall, it's essential to demonstrate that you are adaptable and can work effectively in different environments, but also highlight the type of work culture that you prefer and feel most comfortable in.

作为一个AI语言模型，我个人并没有遇到过挑战。不过，我可以提供一个通用的响应模板。

**Situation**: One of the most challenging things I did was to build a complex React application from scratch for a client.  
情况：我所做的最具挑战性的事情之一是为客户从头开始构建一个复杂的 React 应用程序。

**Obstacles**: The project had a tight deadline, and the application required the integration of various APIs, third-party libraries, and complex functionalities.  
障碍：项目工期紧迫，应用程序需要集成各种API、第三方库和复杂的功能。

**Actions**: I started by breaking down the project into smaller sub-tasks and prioritizing them based on their criticality to the application's overall functionality. I also adopted an agile approach to development, making sure that I communicated regularly with the client to get feedback, make changes, and ensure that the application met their requirements.  
行动：我首先将项目分解为更小的子任务，并根据它们对应用程序整体功能的重要性对它们进行优先级排序。我还采用了敏捷的开发方法，确保定期与客户沟通以获取反馈、进行更改并确保应用程序满足他们的要求。

For example, I had a situation where my team's progress was being dragged down by the backend team's slow implementation of the API. This was causing delays in the integration process, which was impacting our timelines.  
例如，我遇到过这样的情况：我的团队的进度被后端团队缓慢的 API 实现所拖累。这导致了集成过程的延迟，从而影响了我们的时间表。

The obstacles we faced were the backend team's workload and priorities, which made it difficult to get their timely involvement. So, I took the initiative to proactively communicate with them and find out what was causing the delays.  
我们面临的障碍是后端团队的工作量和优先级，这使得他们很难及时参与。于是，我主动主动和他们沟通，找出导致延误的原因。

I spoke with their team lead and identified the specific issues that were causing the delays. Then, I worked with my team and the backend team to come up with alternative solutions and identified the tasks that we could work on independently while their team worked on resolving the issues.  
我与他们的团队负责人进行了交谈，并确定了导致延误的具体问题。然后，我与我的团队和后端团队合作，提出替代解决方案，并确定在他们的团队致力于解决问题时我们可以独立完成的任务。

As a result, we were able to complete our tasks without being overly dependent on the backend team's progress. We were still able to meet our timelines and deliver a high-quality product.  
因此，我们能够完成任务，而不必过度依赖后端团队的进度。我们仍然能够满足我们的时间表并提供高质量的产品。
