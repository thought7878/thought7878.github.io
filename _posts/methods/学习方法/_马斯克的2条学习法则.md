要把知识看作是一种语义树，确保自己理解了基本原理，即主干和大的枝干，然后再了解树叶（细节），否则这些树叶没有附着之处。

## 规则1：确保你正在构建一颗知识之树
不是所有东西都有同等的重要性。在学习中，挂在树枝上的材料，和构成树干基础的材料，是有区别的。这是“外围”和“中心”的区别。

## The Underutilized Tool of Learning
未被充分利用的学习工具

Learning is one of the over communicated but under leveraged tools of the common entrepreneur. Everyone talks about methods of learning, but few people find realistic and authentic techniques that actually yield a net profit in the information and application categories. Elon Musk has broken through that barrier with learning techniques that have proven

学习是普通企业家过度沟通但利用不足的工具之一。每个人都谈论学习的方法，但很少有人能找到实际在信息和应用类别中产生净收益的现实且真实的技术。埃隆·马斯克已经通过被证明成功不止一次的学习技术突破了这一障碍，而且一次又一次地取得了成功。可以有力地

successful not just once, but time and time again. A good argument could be made that Musk has leveraged his learning by becoming a disruptor. He and his companies have shifted entire industries, including the transportation sector, the energy sector, and the space sector. He recently announced at a press conference that his plans for his biotech company, Neuralink, are progressing quite nicely, hinting at yet another sector which his hands will likely shift in the coming years.

论证，马斯克通过成为颠覆者充分利用了他的学习能力。他和他的公司已经改变了整个行业，包括交通行业、能源行业和航天行业。他最近在新闻发布会上宣布，他的生物技术公司Neuralink的计划正在顺利进行，暗示着又一个可能在未来几年因他的努力而发生转变的行业。


## Musk's Genius and Approach to Learning
马斯克的天才之处与学习方法

Yes, Musk is a once in a lifetime genius, likely on the same levels as Nikola Tesla, Albert Einstein, and Isaac Newton. He has a different way of viewing problems than the average entrepreneur. Of course, he reads hundreds of books. He works with top level thinkers. He has astronomical levels of funding to put towards his every whim. But that's not what makes him a great learner. His

是的，马斯克是一个百年难得一遇的天才，很可能与尼古拉·特斯拉、阿尔伯特·爱因斯坦和艾萨克·牛顿处于同一水平。他看待问题的方式与普通企业家不同。当然，他读了数百本书。他与顶级思想家合作。他有天文数字的资金可以投入到他的每一个奇思妙想中。但这些

learning methods aren't that regal. In fact, his two rules for how to learn anything faster can be implemented by anyone at any time, including you. If you wanted, you, too, can be a rocket scientist.

并不是使他成为出色学习者的原因。他的学习方法并不那么高贵。实际上，他的两条加快学习任何事物的规则可以被任何人随时应用，包括你。如果你愿意，你也可以成为一名火箭科学家。


## Building the Semantic Tree of Knowledge
构建知识的语义树

When it comes to learning, Musk is quick to note that he believes that most people can learn more than they currently know. When it comes to the average entrepreneur, Musk claims that they often don't break through their perceived limits and try to learn beyond their current capacity. Or, as he goes on to clarify, they don't know how to outline their information in a way that leads to further revelation. In a conversation on Reddit, Musk discussed his approach to learning and the structure he uses as such. One bit of advice: It is important to view knowledge as sort of a semantic tree.

谈到学习，马斯克很快指出，他认为大多数人可以学到比他们目前所知更多的东西。对于普通的创业者，马斯克声称他们往往无法突破自己感知到的限制，也不尝试超越自己的现有能力去学习。或者，正如他进一步澄清的那样，他们不知道如何以一种能引导更深入理解的方式来整理他们的信息。在 Reddit 的一次对话中，马斯克讨论了他的学习方法以及他所使用的结构。有一条建议：重要的是要把知识看作是一棵语义树。在你进入树叶（细节）之前，一定要先

Make sure you understand the fundamental principles, i.e. the trunk and big branches, before you get into the leaves, details, or there is nothing for them to hang on to.

理解基本原理，也就是树干和大树枝，否则那些细节将无处依附。


## Rule One: Build a Strong Trunk First
第一条规则：先打造坚实的躯干

From this, we begin to see Elon Musk's first rule of thinking.  
**Rule number one: Make sure you're building a tree of knowledge.**  
What does this mean for you practically? It helps the common entrepreneur understand that not everything is weighed with equal gravitas or importance. When it comes to learning, there is a difference between material that ends up hanging from a branch and the material that makes up the base of the trunk of your tree. It's the periphery versus the central.  
Musk is a master of understanding what is at the core of each of the sectors his entrepreneurial ventures sit in. He starts there, ensuring that he has the best possible grasp on

从这里，我们开始看到埃隆·马斯克思考的第一法则。  
**第一法则：确保你构建的是一个知识树。**  
这对你实际操作意味着什么？它帮助普通的创业者理解，并非所有事物都具有同等的力量或重要性。在学习方面，挂在树枝上的材料和构成你知识树树干基础的材料之间存在差异。这是外围与核心的区别。  
马斯克擅长理解他所涉足的每个创业领域的核心内容。他会从核心开始，确保对树干部分有尽可能好的掌握，然后再深入到分支和叶子的细节之中。

the trunk material, before moving off into the minutiae of the branches and the leaves.


## Rule Two: Connect Information Meaningfully
规则二：有意义地连接信息

Many of us do the opposite. We load up on periphery facts, while never fully understanding how or why they connect back to the trunk. This outward facing in method leaves many of our brains overcrowded with misidentified and, ultimately, unimportant knowledge. That's not learning. It's cramming. The result of our efforts is a tree with a toothpick trunk, and an overload of teeming branches, as we try to cram one more idea or thought threatening to snap off within our brains. If you want to learn anything faster, you need to start with the materials that make up the trunk. It might be a tad slower at the onset, but without a sturdy trunk, you won't have the base to support any additional learning and skill.

我们中的许多人恰恰相反。我们堆积了大量边缘事实，却从未完全理解它们如何或为何与主干相连。这种向外扩展的方法使我们的大脑充斥着错误识别的、最终无关紧要的知识。这并不是学习，而是死记硬背。其结果是一棵主干如牙签般脆弱、枝丫却过度繁茂的树，因为我们试图在脑海中塞入又一个想法或观念，而这可能随时断裂。如果你想更快地学习任何东西，就需要从构成主干的内容开始。虽然一开始可能会稍慢一些，但没有坚固的主干，你就无法拥有支撑更多学习和技能的基础。

## Becoming a Master Gardener of Knowledge
成为知识的园艺大师

Elon Musk's learning strategy isn't necessarily in his ability to understand core central concepts. Many entrepreneurs over generations have had solid grasps on core tenets and principles. Musk's brilliance is found in his second rule of learning, which underlines his ability to build vast and towering trees of intellect across multiple sectors.  
**Rule number two: You can't remember what you can't connect.**  
This is how Musk was able to span sectors and shift entire industries seemingly overnight. He started with solid roots and dense trunks. And then, as he began to grow his knowledge upward, he began connecting branches and leaves together with other branches and leaves from other trees. Musk never learns a piece of information at random. Everything he intakes, he connects back to some deeper, more solid base.

埃隆·马斯克的学习策略并不一定在于他理解核心概念的能力。许多企业家在世代相传中都对核心原则和信条有着扎实的掌握。马斯克的天才之处在于他的第二条学习法则，这凸显了他在多个领域构建庞大而高耸的知识体系的能力。  
**第三条规则：你无法记住那些无法连接的信息。**  
这就是马斯克如何能够在看似一夜之间跨越行业并改变整个产业的原因。他从稳固的根基和密集的主干开始，然后当他开始向上扩展知识时，他开始将树枝和树叶与其他树的树枝和树叶连接起来。马斯克从未随机地学习任何信息。他所吸收的一切，都会与某些更深层次、更坚实的基础联系起来。
