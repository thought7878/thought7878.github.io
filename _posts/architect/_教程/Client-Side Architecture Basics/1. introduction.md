Though the tools we use to build client-side web apps have changed substantially over the years, the fundamental principles behind designing robust software have remained relatively the same. In this guide, we go back to basics and discuss a better way to think about the front-end architecture using modern tools like React, xState, and Apollo Client.  
尽管我们用于构建客户端 Web 应用的工具在多年间发生了巨大变化，但*设计健壮软件的基本原则相对保持不变*。在本指南中，我们将*回归基础，讨论如何使用 React、xState 和 Apollo Client 等现代工具来更好地思考前端架构*。

## Welcome 欢迎

When I first learned React and Redux in 2015, I made an enormous mess of the production codebase I was working on.  
2015 年，当我第一次学习 React 和 Redux 时，我弄乱了我正在工作的生产代码库。

Back then, class-based components and Redux were the coolest kids on the block. This was my first time prepping up to work on a real-world React project, so I bought the best courses I could find on the topics and dove in.  
那时，基于类的组件和 Redux 是最酷的。这是我第一次准备参与一个真实的 React 项目，所以我买了能找到的最佳课程，并深入学习了。

After a couple of months, according to the React community, the way I was doing things were outdated. There were newer, cleaner, and recommended *best practices* for me to follow.  
*几个月后，根据 React 社区的说法，我所做的方式已经过时了。有更新的、更干净的和推荐的最佳实践供我遵循*。

I think it's incredible that we question the way we do things. But my vast gap in knowledge of client-side architecture left me always finding it necessary to play catch up to refactor to the *new* approaches.  
我觉得我们质疑自己的做事方式真是不可思议。但我在客户端架构方面的知识空白让我总是觉得有必要不断追赶以重构到新的方法。

These sentiments were also recently echoed in this painfully accurate Twitter thread from [Joel Hooks](https://twitter.com/jhooks).  
这些想法最近也在 Joel Hooks 这条令人痛苦地准确的 Twitter 推文中得到了共鸣。

> Developers are confused about where to start and what to choose when they start learning to write high-quality React applications. They want a strong foundation of knowledge and the confidence to architect React applications at scale built to current industry standards.  
> 当开发者开始学习编写高质量的 React 应用程序时，他们对于从何处开始以及选择什么感到困惑。他们想要扎实的知识基础，以及构建符合当前行业标准的大规模 React 应用程序的信心。

> They are frustrated that there are no widely accepted standards for building React applications consistently, coherently, and **with minimal risks to their professional reputations and livelihoods**.  
> 他们沮丧，因为没有广泛接受的规范来构建一致、连贯且风险最小的 React 应用程序，从而影响他们的职业声誉和生计。

> On top of that, there is a sea of choices and tradeoffs that React developers face every day. From how the project is even started, which framework to use, how to manage state, how does it get bundled, accessibility, and deployment just to get going.  
> 除此之外，React 开发者每天都要面对一个充满选择和权衡的海洋。从项目如何启动，使用哪个框架，如何管理状态，如何打包，可访问性以及部署，仅仅是开始就需要考虑这些问题。

> At each f🐬kin' stop, there's a new choice to make: a new chance to be wrong.  
> 在每个该死的停靠点，都有一个新的选择要做出：一个犯错的新机会。

> Trying to build a solid foundation in React feels like a slot machine. — [@jhooks, June 17th, 2020](https://twitter.com/jhooks/status/1273392253646434304)  
> 在 React 中构建坚实的基础感觉像是在玩老虎机。—— @jhooks，2020 年 6 月 17 日

Some point later in my developer journey, I too realized this was happening. I realized I could never keep up to date with the current trends of the libraries and frameworks I was using. I also decided I didn't want those nuances to dictate my professional reputation or livelihood. It wasn't good enough for me. I needed something better.  
*在我成为开发者的某个时刻，我也意识到了这种情况。我意识到自己永远无法跟上所使用库和框架的当前趋势。我还决定不希望这些细微差别来决定我的职业声誉或生计。这对我不够好。我需要更好的东西。*

Eventually, I sought out the originating principles— the fundamentals, to client-side architecture. I sought out to construct a standard for building client-side apps. A professional one. One based on the software design principles that have helped us design robust software for decades.  
**最终，我开始探寻最初的原则——客户端架构的基础。我寻求构建一个用于开发客户端应用的规范，一个专业的规范。一个基于那些帮助我们在几十年里设计出稳健软件的软件设计原则的规范。**

This guide teaches you client-side architecture fundamentals.  
*本指南教你客户端架构基础知识*。

It's the result of my research using [first principles](https://www.julian.com/blog/mental-model-examples) on how to **design and develop robust, flexible, testable, and maintainable client-side applications.**  
这是我在运用基本原理研究*如何设计和开发健壮、灵活、可测试和可维护的客户端应用程序*的结果。

During my experience working on client-side apps of varying sizes, I've realized that ***some* serious upfront design** on the architecture can have a significant impact on the quality of the code for the duration of its life.  
在我参与过不同规模的客户端应用程序开发过程中，*我意识到在架构上进行充分的前期设计，可以对代码在其整个生命周期中的质量产生重大影响*。

From simple dashboards to multi-layered apps with rendering layers, domain logic, multiple types of users - this guide teaches you the essential design principles front-end developers inadvertently code around within their everyday programming jobs.  
从简单的仪表盘到具有渲染层、领域逻辑、多种类型用户的多层应用程序——*本指南教你前端开发者在日常编程工作中不经意间遵循的必要设计原则*。

**This guide proposes architectural standards for client-side web development**.  
**本指南提出了客户端网页开发的架构标准**。

While we're primarily focused on React, because it's the most popular library with the least structure, the principles are transferrable to any configuration of view-layer library or framework.  
虽然我们主要关注 React，因为它是结构最简单、最受欢迎的库，但这些原则可以应用于任何视图层库或框架的配置。

Programming tends to seem more like a trade than a science. Each tool, be it a state management library, API, or a transport-layer technology, is best suited to solve a particular set of problems. As a developer and a tradesperson, it's good to know how the tools in our toolbox are best used.  
*编程往往更像是一门手艺而非科学*。无论是状态管理库、API 还是传输层技术，***每种工具都最适合解决特定的一组问题。作为一名开发者和手艺人，了解我们工具箱中的工具如何最佳使用***是件好事。

> ... if all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail.  
> ...如果你只有一把锤子，那么所有东西看起来都像钉子。

At the end of this guide, you'll learn a standard for web development. You'll have a clear understanding of the **[discrete layers of concerns](https://khalilstemmler.com/articles/client-side-architecture/layers)** in a client-side app: from the view layer to various forms of state management, and how to handle interaction (app) logic.  
在本文指南的结尾，你将学习一种网页开发的规范。你将*清晰地了解客户端应用程序中各个关注点的分离层次*：从视图层到各种状态管理形式，以及如何处理交互（应用程序）逻辑。
