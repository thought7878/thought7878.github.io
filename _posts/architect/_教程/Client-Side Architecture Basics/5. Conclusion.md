## 工作还没结束
The work isn't over

I know this article expressed a lot of new ideas. To be completely honest, I spent about three months thinking about this off and on, and I'm likely going to spend some time revising it and trying these ideas out with real-world projects.  
我知道*这篇文章表达了很多新想法*。坦白说，我断断续续思考了大约三个月，*很可能还要花些时间修改它，并用实际项目来尝试这些想法*。

Stay tuned for updates on this. If you [subscribe to the newsletter](https://khalilstemmler.com/newsletter), I'll let you know when I publish major updates.  
请关注后续更新。如果你订阅了通讯，我会在发布重大更新时通知你。

Let's look at what we've covered.  
让我们看看我们已经涵盖的内容。

## 一种新的客户端开发理念
A new client-side development philosophy

Zooming out, we started with this:  
*从宏观角度看，我们最初是这样开始的：*

And then zooming in, we landed on this:  
然后，我们进一步聚焦，*得出了这个结论：*

Let's recap the statements I've made.  
让我们回顾一下我所说的内容。

#### Model-View-Presenter 已经无法满足我们的需求了
Model-View-Presenter isn't good enough for our needs anymore

The problems we're solving on the client-side are much more complex than they were 20 years ago. Because of that, the starting point for an architecture probably can't be MVP.  
我们在客户端解决的问题比20年前复杂得多。正因为如此，架构的起点可能无法是MVP。

#### 设计原则长期存在，旨在帮助我们编写更好的软件
Design principles have persisted for a long time to help us write better software

I honestly think that reading books and learning from the past is one of the best ways to avoid future mistakes. Design principles are great. You don't need to always follow them, but know the rules before deciding whether you want to break 'em.  
说实话，我认为读书并从过去学习是避免未来犯错的最佳方式之一。设计原则很棒。你不必总是遵循它们，但在决定是否要打破这些原则之前，要先了解它们。

#### 没有银弹、没有万能的解决方案
There are no silver bullets

There really aren't. With this advanced client-side architecture, what we introduce in structural quality, we lose in developer experience based on the potential learning curve involved. But ask yourself this question: [is the complexity related to nature of the problem itself, or is it just related to the way we're solving it](https://khalilstemmler.com/articles/software-professionalism/accidental-and-essential-complexity/)?
真的没有。凭借这种先进的客户端架构，我们*在结构质量上有所提升，却可能因潜在的学习曲线而在开发者体验上打了折扣*。但请你问问自己：[这种复杂性是与问题本身的性质相关，还是仅仅与我们解决问题的方式有关](https://khalilstemmler.com/articles/software-professionalism/accidental-and-essential-complexity/)？

#### 这是为那些对“用适合自己的东西”感到畏缩，并且希望为严密的React架构找到一个良好概念起点的开发者准备的。
This is for developers where "use what works for you" is daunting, and would like a good conceptual starting point for an air tight React architecture

I'm really excited about these ideas. I've been milling around with this for a couple of months now but I think it's really important today. If you're a developer that has been told to use "what works for you", that's still incredibly good advice. But if you run into any of the pain-points in your React project like suddenly facing issues adding features, changing code, and feeling like things have turned to mush, this might help.
我对这些想法真的很兴奋。我已经琢磨了几个月了，但我觉得现在这个话题非常重要。如果你是一名开发者，有人告诉你“用对你有用的东西”，这仍然是非常好的建议。*但如果在你的React项目中遇到了任何痛点，比如突然在添加功能、修改代码时遇到问题，感觉一切都变得一团糟，那这可能会有所帮助。*

## 后续步骤
Next steps

We shouldn't stop here. Here are a few thoughts to chew on. Feel free to ask questions and leave suggestions on ways I can make this guide more helpful.
我们不应该就此止步。这里有一些值得思考的想法。欢迎大家提出问题，并就如何让这份指南更有帮助给出建议。

**Choosing a stack**: Given this philosophy, what factors into deciding upon a stack? Compatibility? Developer experience? Maintainer(s) activity?
**选择技术栈**：基于这一理念，*决定技术栈时需要考虑哪些因素？兼容性？开发者体验？维护者的活跃度？*

**Organizing code:** How do you organize code within a React project? What principles are at play?
**代码组织：** *你如何在React项目中组织代码？涉及哪些原则？*

**Dealing with prop drilling**: If we have these clear-cut layers, doesn't that mean we'll have to do a lot of prop drilling?
**处理属性传递问题**：*如果我们有这些明确的层级，那是不是意味着我们要进行大量的属性传递？*

**Test-Driven Development**: Can we discuss testing in more detail? What does a test-driven approach to client-side application development look like in 2020? Should we write BDD-style acceptance tests with React Testing Library and Jest? Or should invest into testing for functional correctness using E2E tools like Cypress.io?
**测试驱动开发**：我们可以更详细地讨论测试吗？2020年，客户端应用开发的测试驱动方法是什么样的？我们应该使用React Testing Library和Jest编写BDD风格的验收测试吗？还是应该投资于使用Cypress.io等端到端工具进行功能正确性测试？

**Real-life project**: What does this look like in practice?
**实际项目**：这在实践中是什么样子的？
