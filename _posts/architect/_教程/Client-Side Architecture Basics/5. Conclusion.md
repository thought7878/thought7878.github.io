## The work isn't over工作还没结束

I know this article expressed a lot of new ideas. To be completely honest, I spent about three months thinking about this off and on, and I'm likely going to spend some time revising it and trying these ideas out with real-world projects.  
我知道这篇文章表达了很多新想法。坦白说，我断断续续思考了大约三个月，很可能还要花些时间修改它，并用实际项目来尝试这些想法。

Stay tuned for updates on this. If you [subscribe to the newsletter](https://khalilstemmler.com/newsletter), I'll let you know when I publish major updates.  
请关注后续更新。如果你订阅了通讯，我会在发布重大更新时通知你。

Let's look at what we've covered.  
让我们看看我们已经涵盖的内容。

## A new client-side development philosophy一种新的客户端开发理念

Zooming out, we started with this:  
从宏观角度看，我们最初是这样开始的：

![[_posts/architect/_教程/Client-Side Architecture Basics/media/627f3599f3956086c53b8b1353f51839_MD5.png]]

And then zooming in, we landed on this:  
然后聚焦细节，我们最终达到了这一点：

Let's recap the statements I've made.  
让我们回顾一下我所说的内容。

#### Model-View-Presenter isn't good enough for our needs anymoreModel-View-Presenter 已经无法满足我们的需求了

The problems we're solving on the client-side are much more complex than they were 20 years ago. Because of that, the starting point for an architecture probably can't be MVP.  
我们目前在客户端解决的问题比 20 年前复杂得多。正因为如此，架构的起点可能不能是 MVP。

#### Design principles have persisted for a long time to help us write better software设计原则长期以来一直存在，以帮助我们编写更好的软件

I honestly think that reading books and learning from the past is one of the best ways to avoid future mistakes. Design principles are great. You don't need to always follow them, but know the rules before deciding whether you want to break 'em.  
我真诚地认为，阅读书籍和从历史中学习是避免未来错误的最佳方式之一。设计原则很棒。你不必总是遵循它们，但在决定是否要打破它们之前，要先了解规则。

#### There are no silver bullets没有银弹

There really aren't. With this advanced client-side architecture, what we introduce in structural quality, we lose in developer experience based on the potential learning curve involved. But ask yourself this question: [is the complexity related to nature of the problem itself, or is it just related to the way we're solving it](https://khalilstemmler.com/articles/software-professionalism/accidental-and-essential-complexity/)?  
真的没有。在这个先进的客户端架构中，我们在结构质量上引入的内容，基于潜在的学习曲线，我们在开发者体验上有所损失。但问自己这个问题：这种复杂性是与问题的本质相关，还是仅仅与我们解决问题的方式相关？

I'm really excited about these ideas. I've been milling around with this for a couple of months now but I think it's really important today. If you're a developer that has been told to use "what works for you", that's still incredibly good advice. But if you run into any of the pain-points in your React project like suddenly facing issues adding features, changing code, and feeling like things have turned to mush, this might help.  
我对这些想法非常兴奋。我已经在这个问题上徘徊了几个月了，但我认为今天它真的非常重要。如果你是一个被告知要使用“对你有效的方法”的开发者，那这仍然是非常好的建议。但如果你在 React 项目中遇到了任何痛点，比如突然面临添加功能、修改代码的问题，感觉事情变得一团糟，这可能会有所帮助。

We shouldn't stop here. Here are a few thoughts to chew on. Feel free to ask questions and leave suggestions on ways I can make this guide more helpful.  
我们不应止步于此。这里有一些值得思考的观点。欢迎提问并提出建议，帮助我使这份指南更加实用。

**Choosing a stack**: Given this philosophy, what factors into deciding upon a stack? Compatibility? Developer experience? Maintainer(s) activity?  
选择技术栈：基于这种理念，选择技术栈时需要考虑哪些因素？兼容性？开发者体验？维护者的活跃度？

**Organizing code:** How do you organize code within a React project? What principles are at play?  
代码组织：在 React 项目中如何组织代码？其中涉及哪些原则？

**Dealing with prop drilling**: If we have these clear-cut layers, doesn't that mean we'll have to do a lot of prop drilling?  
处理属性穿透：如果我们有这些明确的层次，难道不是意味着我们需要做很多属性穿透吗？

**Test-Driven Development**: Can we discuss testing in more detail? What does a test-driven approach to client-side application development look like in 2020? Should we write BDD-style acceptance tests with React Testing Library and Jest? Or should invest into testing for functional correctness using E2E tools like Cypress.io?  
测试驱动开发：我们能更详细地讨论测试吗？2020 年客户端应用程序开发的测试驱动方法是什么样的？我们应该使用 React Testing Library 和 Jest 编写 BDD 风格的验收测试吗？还是应该投资于使用 Cypress.io 等端到端工具进行功能正确性测试？

**Real-life project**: What does this look like in practice?  
实际项目：这在实践中是什么样子？
