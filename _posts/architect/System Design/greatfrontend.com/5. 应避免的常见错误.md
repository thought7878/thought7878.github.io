## 前端系统设计面试中应避免的常见错误
Common Mistakes to Avoid for Front End System Design Interviews

Know the mistakes candidates often make during front end system design interviews and how to avoid them.  
了解候选人在前端系统设计面试中**经常犯的错误以及如何避免这些错误**。

Unlike coding interviews which are much more common and you can somewhat practice/simulate interview conditions, it is much harder to practice for system design interviews.  
不像编码面试更常见，你可以在某种程度上练习/模拟面试条件，系统设计面试更难练习。

Here's a list of common mistakes made by candidates when they are answering system design interview questions and many of them are not specific to front end system design interviews. Hopefully you will remember these points and avoid them for your own interviews.  
以下是候选人在回答系统设计面试问题时所犯的常见错误，其中许多错误并不特定于前端系统设计面试。希望你能记住这些要点，并在面试中避免它们。

## 马上回答这个问题
Jumping into answering the question immediately 

Don't jump into answering the question immediately! Take the time to gather requirements and clarify assumptions by asking questions. Answering the wrong question well is worse than answering the right question poorly.  
**不要马上回答这个问题！花时间收集需求，并通过提问来澄清假设。回答错误的问题比回答正确的问题更糟糕。**

## 以无组织的方式处理问题
Approaching the question in an unstructured manner 

Because system design interviews are very open-ended with no explicit completion milestone (unlike coding interviews where you have to produce working code), some candidates might just talk about whatever that comes to their mind and the answer might end up appearing messy to the interviewer. Use the RADIO framework to help you.  
*因为系统设计面试是非常开放的，没有明确的完成里程碑*（不像编码面试，你必须产生工作代码），一些候选人可能*只是谈论他们想到的任何东西，而答案可能最终会让面试官看起来很混乱*。**使用 RADIO 框架来帮助您**。

Write down each step of the RADIO framework on the whiteboard at the start of the interview and ensure that by the end of the interview you have covered each section sufficiently. Note that you don't necessarily have to complete each section in order and you can always revisit previous sections if you've missed out on certain things.  
**在面试开始时，在白板上写下 RADIO 框架的每个步骤，并确保在面试结束时，你已经充分覆盖了每个部分**。请注意，您*不必按顺序完成每个部分，如果您错过了某些内容，您可以随时重新访问前面的部分*。

## Insisting on only one solution or the best solution 坚持只有一个解决方案或最佳解决方案

Don't insist there's only one solution, especially if the interviewer prompts you for alternative approaches. More often than not, there are multiple ways to solve a problem, each with its own tradeoffs.  
不要坚持只有一个解决方案，特别是如果面试官提示你其他方法。通常情况下，有多种方法可以解决一个问题，每种方法都有自己的权衡。

The interviewer wants to see you identify a solution with the right tradeoffs for the issue at hand, not you saying that there's only one right or best solution. The other solutions might be clearly bad and is very obvious to you, but the interviewer wants to hear you explain why they are bad.  
面试官希望看到你为手头的问题找到一个正确的解决方案，而不是说只有一个正确的或最好的解决方案。其他的解决方案可能很明显是不好的，对你来说是非常明显的，但是面试官想听到你解释为什么它们是不好的。

## Remaining silent the entire time 一直保持沉默

On the opposite of the spectrum of answering too quickly, there are people who remain too silent. Don't remain silent the entire time and thinking only in your head – think out loud!  
与回答得太快的人相反，有些人保持太沉默。不要一直保持沉默，只在脑子里思考--大声思考！

System design interviews are meant to be collaborative exercises between you and the interviewer. Treat your interviewer as a coworker, bring up issues you've identified, bounce ideas, and discuss possible solutions with them.  
系统设计面试是你和面试官之间的合作练习。把你的面试官当作同事，提出你已经发现的问题，交换意见，并与他们讨论可能的解决方案。

## Going down a rabbit hole 掉进兔子洞

Don't go down a rabbit hole of diving too deep into a particular component. Define an initial architecture/high-level design first, then proceed to elaborate on the various parts of the system. Focus on the parts which are most important to the problem.  
不要陷入一个兔子洞，也不要深入到一个特定的组件中。首先定义一个初始架构/高级设计，然后继续详细说明系统的各个部分。把注意力集中在对问题最重要的部分。

If you are unsure, ask the interviewer if you should dive deeper into a specific component. It'd be bad to spend too much time discussing about an unimportant component, wasting precious time without providing useful signals to the interviewer.  
如果你不确定，问面试官你是否应该深入研究一个特定的组件。花太多时间讨论一个不重要的部分是不好的，浪费了宝贵的时间而没有给面试官提供有用的信号。

## Using buzzwords without being able to explain them 使用流行语而无法解释它们

Don't use buzzwords or terms you can't explain well. It might be tempting to throw out some cool terms like "Virtual DOM", "DOM Reconciliation", "Partial Hydration", "Streaming Server-side Rendering" and you can if they're relevant to the current topic!  
不要使用你不能很好解释的流行语或术语。抛出一些很酷的术语可能很诱人，比如“虚拟 DOM”，“DOM 协调”，“部分水合”，“流服务器端渲染”，如果它们与当前主题相关，您可以这样做！

However, if you do, make sure you are able to explain the term you just used as your interviewer is likely going to probe for more information to test your knowledge. It's a red flag if you are unable to explain the term you just used.  
然而，如果你这样做，确保你能够解释你刚才使用的术语，因为你的面试官可能会探索更多的信息来测试你的知识。如果你不能解释你刚才使用的术语，这是一个危险信号。
