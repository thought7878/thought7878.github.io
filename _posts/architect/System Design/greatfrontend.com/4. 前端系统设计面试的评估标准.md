## Evaluation Criteria for Front End System Design Interviews前端系统设计面试的评估标准

Specific behaviors and signals interviewers look out for in front end system design interviews.  
在前端系统设计面试中，面试官要注意的特定行为和信号。

During interviews, interviewers look out for signals displayed by candidates before making an overall hiring and leveling recommendation. The more desired behaviors the candidate displays, the higher the likelihood the interviewer will recommend a "Hire" decision. The more detailed and mature the answers are, the higher the leveling recommendation.  
在面试过程中，面试官在做出整体招聘和评估建议之前，会留意候选人表现出的信号。候选人表现出的行为越令人满意，面试官就越有可能推荐“雇用”决定。答案越详细、越成熟，平级推荐度越高。

This section lists some of the behaviors that candidates should display. Bear them in mind as you are answering the system design question and demonstrate them confidently during the interview.  
本节列出了候选人应表现出的一些行为。在回答系统设计问题时，请牢记这些原则，并在面试中自信地展示这些原则。

## Problem exploration 问题探索

- Demonstrated thorough understanding of the problem.  
	表现出对问题的透彻理解。
- Explored the requirements sufficiently by asking relevant clarifying questions to minimize ambiguities.  
	通过提出相关的澄清问题来充分探索要求，以尽量减少歧义。
- Gathered functional and non-functional requirements of the problem.  
	收集功能性和非功能性需求的问题。
- Defined the scope of the problem.  
	定义了问题的范围。
- Identified the important aspects of the problem to focus on and address.  
	确定了问题的重点和解决的重要方面。

**Relevant framework sections:**Requirements exploration

## Architecture 架构

- Developed an architecture that solved the entire problem sufficiently.  
	开发了一个架构，充分解决了整个问题。
- Broke down the problem into smaller independent parts of suitable granularity.  
	把问题分解成粒度合适的独立的小部分。
- Identified components of the system and defined their responsibilities clearly.  
	确定了系统的组成部分，并明确界定了其职责。
- Articulated how these components will work together and defined/described the API between these components.  
	阐明这些组件将如何协同工作，并定义/描述这些组件之间的 API。
- Developed an architecture that can be put into practice.  
	开发了一个可以付诸实践的架构。
- Developed an architecture with scalability and reusability in mind, one that can be extended to support future requirements.  
	开发了一个具有可伸缩性和可重用性的体系结构，可以扩展以支持未来的需求。

## Technical proficiency 技术熟练程度

- Demonstrated technical knowledge and proficiency of front end fundamentals, common technologies and APIs.  
	具备技术知识，精通前端基础知识、常用技术和 API。
- Able to dive into specific front end domain areas where relevant to the problem.  
	能够深入到与问题相关的特定前端领域。
- Identified areas which need to be paid special attention to and addressed them by proposing solutions and analyzing their tradeoffs.  
	确定需要特别注意的领域，并通过提出解决方案和分析其权衡来解决这些问题。

*Front end domain areas include Performance, Networking, HTML/CSS, Accessibility, Internationalization, Security, Scalability, etc.  
前端领域包括性能、网络、HTML/CSS、可访问性、国际化、安全性、可扩展性等。*

**Relevant framework sections:**Architecture / High-level design, Optimizations and deep dive  
**相关框架章节：** 架构/高级设计、优化和深入研究

## Exploration and tradeoffs 探索和权衡

- Offered various possible solutions to the problems at hand and explained the pros and cons of each solution.  
	为手头的问题提供了各种可能的解决方案，并解释了每个解决方案的优缺点。
	- The "problem" here doesn't necessarily refer to the given system design question.  
		这里的“问题”并不一定指给定的系统设计问题。
	- While solving the given question, there would be smaller problems to solve/questions to answer and each small problem/question can have various solutions and choices to make.  
		在解决给定的问题时，会有更小的问题要解决/回答，每个小问题/问题都可以有各种解决方案和选择。
- Explained the suitability of the solutions given the context and requirements and provided recommendations for the context of the question.  
	解释解决方案在特定背景和要求下的适用性，并针对问题背景提供建议。
	- Do not insist there is only one possible solution. Good questions usually have a few possible solutions where the suitability of each depends on the context.  
		不要坚持只有一个可能的解决方案。好的问题通常有几个可能的解决方案，每个解决方案的适用性取决于上下文。
	- Even if the other solutions are clearly and obviously bad, do still mention them and briefly explain why they are bad.  
		即使其他的解决方案明显是不好的，也要提到它们，并简要解释它们为什么不好。

## Product and UX sense 产品和用户体验

- Proposed a robust solution that lays the foundation of a good product.  
	提出了一个强大的解决方案，奠定了良好的产品基础。
- Considered user experience when answering: loading states, performance (perceived or actual), mobile friendliness, keyboard friendliness, etc.  
	回答时考虑用户体验：加载状态、性能（感知或实际）、移动的友好性、键盘友好性等。
- Considered error cases and suggested ways to handle them.  
	考虑了错误情况并提出了处理方法。
