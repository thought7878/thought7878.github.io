JavaScript was initially created by Brendan Eich of NetScape and was first announced in a press release by Netscape in 1995. It has a bizarre history of naming; initially, it was named Mocha by the creator, which was later renamed LiveScript. In 1996, about a year later after the release, NetScape decided to rename it to JavaScript with hopes of capitalizing on the Java community (although JavaScript did not have any relationship with Java) and released Netscape 2.0 with the official support of JavaScript.  

JavaScript 最初由 NetScape 的 Brendan Eich 创建，并于 1995 年在 Netscape 的新闻稿中首次宣布。最初，它被创建者命名为Mocha，后来更名为LiveScript。 1996年，大约发布一年后，NetScape决定将其重命名为JavaScript，希望利用Java社区的优势（尽管JavaScript与Java没有任何关系），并发布了官方支持Ja​​vaScript的Netscape 2.0。
